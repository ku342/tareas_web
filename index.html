P360 10-Minute Script (continuous speech)

Now I want to share a little about my experience teaching different generations.
One thing I’ve learned is that every group is different.
Different ages, different mindsets, different ways of learning.
And that means I cannot always use the same approach.
I need to adapt myself to the people in front of me.

From the first day at Alorica, I saw that.
Some agents learn fast with visuals.
Some need practice to feel secure.
Others prefer just talking, asking questions, and listening to examples.
So I learned to change my style depending on the group.
I don’t teach robots. I teach people. And people need connection.

Ana once told me, ‘We don’t work with robots, we work with humans.’
That phrase has been an anchor for me.
Because it reminds me that teaching is not just about process, it is about people.
When I understand what motivates someone, then I know how to guide them.
If someone is motivated by recognition, I show them how their results are noticed.
If someone wants growth, I show them how learning opens doors.

Teaching different generations has also taught me that it’s not only one way.
I don’t just give knowledge, I also receive.
Agents share new ideas, new ways of saying things, even new energy.
And that helps me grow too.
It is an exchange — I give something, they give something back.

For me, this is the most important part:
When people feel understood, they are ready to learn.
And when they learn, results follow.
That has been the story of my path — adapting to different styles, connecting with people, and seeing them grow.

So when I think about the Learning Associate role, I don’t see it as only sharing knowledge.
I see it as guiding people, adapting to them, and helping them bring out their best version.
Because at the end of the day, every generation is different.
But the heart is always the same: people grow when they feel understood.”

            Teaching Different Generations — 5 Minute Script (Alternative)

“When I think about teaching, the first thing that comes to my mind is diversity.
Not diversity of culture only, but diversity of learning.
Every time I work with a new group, I discover that no two groups are the same.

In one group, I may have younger agents, very fast with technology, but sometimes impatient.
In another group, I may have older agents, who bring discipline and focus, but sometimes need more time with the systems.
And in between, I see every style — people who need to write notes, people who need to practice, people who need to ask a lot of questions.

For me, the challenge is to connect with all of them.
So I don’t use only one way.
I bring variety. I use visuals, I use stories, I use role examples.
Sometimes I slow down. Sometimes I push a little faster.
It all depends on the people in front of me.

The key is respect.
When people feel respected, they open to learn.
And when they open, they grow.
That’s what I’ve seen — if you respect the way someone learns, they will give you results.

But teaching is not one way.
I also learn from them.
Younger agents show me shortcuts and fresh ideas.
Older agents show me patience and wisdom.
This exchange is powerful, because it builds community, not just knowledge.

In the end, teaching different generations has taught me one big lesson:
It is not about having the perfect method.
It is about adapting and staying human.
Because knowledge without connection doesn’t work.
But when you connect first, everything else flows.

That’s why in this role, I see myself not only as a trainer, but as a bridge.
A bridge between generations, between styles, and between goals and results.
And that is what I want to bring to the Learning Associate position.”

“Let’s talk about Protection 360, or P360.
Who here has ever dropped a phone? Or maybe broken a screen? [pause, smile]
It happens to all of us, and we all know how it feels. You hear the sound, you see the crack, and right away you start thinking about the cost. It is stressful, not only because the phone is broken, but because inside that phone is our life — pictures, contacts, and memories.

P360 exists because of that. Life happens. Phones fall. Phones get stolen. Phones stop working when we least expect it. And when that happens, customers lose more than just a device. They lose money, they lose time, and sometimes they lose their connection with the people who matter the most. That’s why P360 is not just a product, it is peace of mind.

P360 is very complete. It covers loss, theft, and damage. It also covers breakdowns, even after the warranty. For iPhone users, it includes AppleCare. For every customer, it brings McAfee digital security. That means protection for identity, safe browsing, and alerts if their information is stolen. And one of the biggest benefits is the cost of repairs. Customers can have unlimited screen repairs. The front screen is repaired for zero dollars, and the back glass for only twenty-nine dollars. If you don’t have P360, one broken screen can cost three hundred seventy-nine dollars. If you lose your phone, it can cost eight hundred dollars or more. So when customers hear that, they realize the value right away.

Why does this matter? Because most people have already lived it. Studies show that fifty-three percent of people have lost or broken a phone. And seventy-two percent of them have had it happen more than once. So when we offer P360, we are not pushing something extra. We are giving them a solution to a problem they probably already had before. We are protecting something that is important to them, and we are making their life easier.

The cost is around eighteen dollars per month. For that price, customers get more than forty dollars in value, and they can save thousands of dollars if something happens. But the value is not only in money. The value is also in peace of mind. It is the feeling that no matter what happens, they are covered. Their device is safe, their data is safe, and their connection is safe.

Now let’s talk about what we win. Because P360 is also good for us. First, recognition. With P360, we can be part of Revenue Ambassador challenges. Teams get recognition, we celebrate wins, and we feel the impact of our work. Second, bonuses. When we grow attaches, we grow our numbers, and that means more rewards for agents. And third, trust. Every attach helps Alorica show T-Mobile that we can deliver on priorities. We reduce churn, we increase NPS, and we prove that we can make a hot topic a real success.

Let’s look at the results. In May, attaches started at twelve percent. Then they grew to twenty-eight percent. And then they grew again, to more than forty-three percent. Our goal is forty-five percent, and we are almost there. What makes me proud is not just the growth, but the quality. Retention has stayed near one hundred percent. Customers are not canceling. They see the value, they accept the protection, and they keep it. That is real proof.

So what do these numbers tell us? They tell us that P360 is becoming the standard. When a customer upgrades, they don’t only want the phone. They want the full package — the phone, the accessories, and the protection. When a customer adds a line, it is the same. They expect the device to come protected. So P360 should not be something extra. It should be part of every complete order. The same way we don’t give a phone without a SIM card, we should not give a phone without protection.

That is the future. That is how we create full solutions, not half solutions. And when we treat P360 as a standard, everyone wins. Customers feel safe. Agents feel confident. And Alorica shows T-Mobile that we can deliver consistent results.

So in closing, P360 is not just a hot topic. It is a habit we are building. It is part of our culture now. When we include it in every upgrade and every add-a-line, we don’t only reach forty-five percent. We create better experiences for customers. We give recognition and bonuses to agents. And we build stronger trust between Alorica and T-Mobile.

That is why I believe P360 is not optional. It is the standard every customer should have. Because at the end of the day, we don’t just protect phones. We protect what people love.”
